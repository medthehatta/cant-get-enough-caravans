trello and vscode integration?
introduce path / traversal object which is basically a list of tiles with their properties
    - the idea is this can be provided to a ExpeditionEvaluator with the
      Expedition/Caravan and it will estimate the dynamic properties like xp,
      stress, durability etc
XP gain (person)
stress gain (person)
durability loss (equipment)
calorie consumption (person)
fuel / power consumption (equipment)
inventory slot to show stacks
"teaching" stat?  (or does xp of a certain type give you it automatically?)
